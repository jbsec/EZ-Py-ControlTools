# EZ-Py-ControlTools
Welcome to Easy Python Control Tools. 

This a collection of "control tools" I have made in Python which can be used by network admins, supervisors, which allow one user "the admin" to control and monitor another a device on another network. There are a few useful tools here which can be used on Windows 10-11 machines. This is useful to you if you are wishing to gain greater control over devices on your network and do not wish to install additional clunky software to do this.

Only works over local networks (Such as your home Wi-Fi). 

- BuddyViewer (View events and keystrokes of a friends PC).
- RemoteController (Send commands to a friends PC).
- PicUpdates (View screenshots of the desktop on a time freq of your choosing).
- RemoteInfoBackup (Export saved data, passwords, files, to your PC from another PC).
- TimeOut (Remotely lock a PC from being used or input to).
- RemoteClearing (Remotely clear the OS data in need of emergency).
- HomeCamera (Remotely activate your home WebCam and Mic).
